## Contributing

We use the pull-request model, see [GitHub's help on pull-request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

In brief, you will:

- add an issue about what you plan to change;
- on GitHub, find and fork the source repository;
- on your computer, clone your fork repository,
- commit your changes in a new branch;
- push your branch and submit a pull-request for it;
- go through the review process until your pull-request is merged; and
- close your issue.
