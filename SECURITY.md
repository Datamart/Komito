## Reporting a Bug

Thank you for improving the security of `Komito Analytics`. We appreciate your
efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge
your contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing the lead maintainer at support@komito.net.

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will send a
more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling
your report. After the initial reply to your report, our team will
endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full
announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

## Disclosure Policy

When our team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a
primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance.
